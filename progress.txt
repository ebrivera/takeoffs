## Codebase Patterns
- Use `<Link>` from `next/link` for internal navigation — ESLint `@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages` rule forbids `<a href="/">`
- PyMuPDF `get_drawings()` "re" items have 3 elements: `("re", Rect, orientation_flag)` — check `len(item) >= 2` not `== 2`
- PyMuPDF drawing dict values are typed `object` — use `isinstance(raw, (int, float))` guard before `float()` for mypy strict
- Geometry models use frozen dataclasses (not Pydantic) for internal service types — consistent with pipeline.py pattern
- `cantena/geometry/` package: `extractor.py` (VectorExtractor, DrawingData, VectorPath, Point2D, BoundingRect, PathType), `scale.py` (ScaleDetector, ScaleResult, TextBlock, Confidence, parse_dimension_string), `walls.py` (WallDetector, WallSegment, WallAnalysis, Orientation), `measurement.py` (MeasurementService, PageMeasurements, MeasurementConfidence, pts_to_real_sf, pts_to_real_lf)
- Shapely 2.x needs `types-shapely` pip package for mypy stubs — `convex_hull` returns `BaseGeometry`, must `isinstance(hull, Polygon)` before `.exterior`
- `AnalyzeResponse` type in `types.ts` wraps the full backend response (estimate + analysis + metadata)
- Tailwind v4 uses `@theme inline` and CSS custom properties — reference with `var(--color-navy-xxx)` in className
- Python 3.11+ with pydantic v2 for domain models
- Project lives in `backend/` — source in `backend/cantena/`, tests in `backend/tests/`
- Quality gates: `pytest`, `mypy --strict cantena`, `ruff check cantena tests` (run from backend/ with venv activated)
- Use `source .venv/bin/activate` before running any Python tooling
- Frontend lives in `frontend/` — Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript strict mode
- Frontend quality gates: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` (run from frontend/)
- Landing page at `/` is out of scope — product work lives under `/analyze` route
- Cost engine foundation (PRD 1) is complete — all models, engine, data, and formatting in `cantena/`
- Frontend types in `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` must mirror Python models exactly (enums as TS enums, interfaces for Pydantic models)
- Frontend API client in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — typed fetch wrappers
- `npm install` required before running quality gates (node_modules not committed)
- Use `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` from `frontend/` directory
- Services live in `cantena/services/` — new package created for PDF, VLM, pipeline services
- PyMuPDF (`fitz`) needs `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` for mypy (no stubs available)
- `anthropic` SDK has type stubs — do NOT add `# type: ignore[import-untyped]`
- Use `ImageBlockParam` and `TextBlockParam` from `anthropic.types` for typed message content
- System prompt strings must stay within 100-char line limit — use string concatenation `()`
- Use dataclasses (not Pydantic) for internal service result types — Pydantic reserved for domain models
- Empty PDFs (0 pages) are valid and should return empty result, not error
- Custom exceptions in `cantena/exceptions.py`: CantenaError base, PdfProcessingError, VlmAnalysisError, CostEstimationError
- Pipeline wraps errors from each stage into typed exceptions — don't double-wrap if already the correct type
- Use `TYPE_CHECKING` block for imports only used in type annotations (TC001/TC003) — runtime imports stay outside
- `AnalysisContext` from `vlm_analyzer` is used at runtime (instantiated in pipeline) — keep outside TYPE_CHECKING
- FastAPI `app.state` attributes are dynamically typed — mypy doesn't need `type: ignore[attr-defined]` comments
- Use `create_app(pipeline=mock)` factory pattern for test dependency injection — no env vars needed
- FastAPI TestClient for sync tests: `client.post("/api/analyze", files=..., data=...)` for multipart form
- Pydantic models used as FastAPI request body params need `# noqa: TCH001` — FastAPI resolves annotations at runtime
- `create_app(cost_engine=mock)` for testing /api/estimate — separate from pipeline injection
- `CostEngine.estimate(building, project_name)` takes BuildingModel + project name, returns CostEstimate
- `/api/analyze` response includes `building_model` field — full BuildingModel JSON for frontend parameter editing
- `estimateFromModel(building)` in `api.ts` POSTs BuildingModel JSON to `/api/estimate` — no PDF/VLM needed
- Use `structuredClone()` for deep-copying BuildingModel state in React (avoids mutation)
- VlmAnalyzer `timeout` param (default 60s) passes through to `anthropic.Anthropic(timeout=...)` — no need for httpx
- `GET /api/sample-estimate` returns a realistic pre-built estimate — no API key needed, good for demos
- API key check: `os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")` in `/api/analyze` — returns 400 with helpful message if missing
- Use `@patch.dict("os.environ", {}, clear=True)` to test API key absence — env may have the key set
- Error boundary in `analyze/error-boundary.tsx` as class component; wired through `analyze/layout.tsx`

## 2026-02-07 - US-101
- What was implemented: Frontend scaffolding — added typecheck script, TypeScript interfaces matching all Python Pydantic models, typed API fetch wrapper, and /analyze page entry point.
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/package.json` — added `typecheck: "tsc --noEmit"` script
  - `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` — TypeScript enums and interfaces for BuildingType, StructuralSystem, ExteriorWall, MechanicalSystem, ElectricalService, FireProtection, Confidence, Location, ComplexityScores, BuildingModel, CostRange, DivisionCost, Assumption, BuildingSummary, EstimateMetadata, CostEstimate
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — `analyzePlan(file, location)` fetch wrapper targeting POST /api/analyze
  - `frontend/src/app/analyze/page.tsx` — minimal product analysis page at /analyze route
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Node modules must be installed first (`npm install` from frontend/) before running quality gates
  - TypeScript enums match Python StrEnum values exactly — use string values not uppercase keys
  - `generated_at` is `string` in TS (JSON serialized datetime) not Date object
  - Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*` — use `@/lib/types` for imports
  - The PRD says `frontend/lib/types.ts` but actual path is `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` (under src/ per Next.js App Router convention)
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-102
- What was implemented: PDF processing service — PdfProcessor class that converts PDF pages to 200 DPI PNG images with text extraction and title block heuristic.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/pyproject.toml` — added PyMuPDF and Pillow dependencies
  - `backend/cantena/services/__init__.py` — new services package
  - `backend/cantena/services/pdf_processor.py` — PdfProcessor, PageResult, PdfProcessingResult classes
  - `backend/tests/test_pdf_processor.py` — 11 tests covering processing, text extraction, cleanup, and error handling
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PyMuPDF (`import fitz`) has no type stubs — use `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` on the import
  - PyMuPDF cannot save a zero-page PDF (`ValueError: cannot save with zero pages`) — create test empty PDFs with raw bytes instead
  - Output directories must be created before fitz tries to write images (`mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`)
  - fitz uses 72 DPI as baseline — zoom factor = target_dpi / 72 (e.g., 200/72 ≈ 2.78)
  - Title block text lives in the bottom-right quadrant of construction drawings — use `page.get_text(clip=rect)` for extraction
  - Use `contextlib.suppress(OSError)` instead of try/except/pass per ruff SIM105
  - ruff `--fix` auto-handles I001 import sorting
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-103
- What was implemented: VLM analysis service — VlmAnalyzer class that sends construction drawing images to Anthropic Vision API and returns a structured BuildingModel.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/services/vlm_analyzer.py` — VlmAnalyzer, AnalysisContext, VlmAnalysisResult classes, SYSTEM_PROMPT constant
  - `backend/tests/test_vlm_analyzer.py` — 13 tests covering well-formed parsing, retry on malformed, missing field defaults, context passthrough, error handling
  - `backend/pyproject.toml` — added `anthropic>=0.39.0` dependency
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `anthropic` SDK ships with type stubs — no `type: ignore` needed (unlike PyMuPDF)
  - Use `ImageBlockParam` and `TextBlockParam` from `anthropic.types` for typed API content arrays
  - mypy requires proper typed dicts for Anthropic API `messages[].content` — plain `dict[str, Any]` fails
  - Long string constants (system prompts) must use `()` string concatenation to stay under 100-char line limit for ruff E501
  - Mock `analyzer._client.messages.create` with `patch.object` for testing — mock response needs `.content[].type` and `.content[].text` attributes
  - Create minimal valid PNGs in tests using raw struct/zlib — no need for Pillow in test deps
  - Use `with (ctx1, ctx2):` syntax (Python 3.10+) instead of nested `with` per ruff SIM117
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-104
- What was implemented: Analysis pipeline — AnalysisPipeline orchestrator that chains PDF → VLM → CostEngine, plus custom exception hierarchy in cantena/exceptions.py.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/exceptions.py` — CantenaError base, PdfProcessingError, VlmAnalysisError, CostEstimationError
  - `backend/cantena/services/pipeline.py` — AnalysisPipeline class, PipelineResult dataclass, page selection heuristic
  - `backend/tests/test_pipeline.py` — 14 tests covering happy path, page selection, error wrapping, cleanup on failure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pipeline wraps errors from each stage into typed exceptions — use `isinstance` check to avoid double-wrapping
  - Page selection heuristic: title block "floor plan" match > largest page by pixel area > page 1
  - `AnalysisContext` is used at runtime (instantiated in `analyze()`) — must import outside `TYPE_CHECKING`
  - All other pipeline type imports (`PdfProcessor`, `VlmAnalyzer`, `CostEngine`, result types) can go in `TYPE_CHECKING` since they're only in annotations
  - `time.monotonic()` for timing (not `time.time()`) — monotonic is not affected by system clock changes
  - `finally` block ensures cleanup even on exceptions — check `pdf_result is not None` before calling cleanup
  - Use `MagicMock(spec=ClassName)` for service mocks in tests — catches wrong method names
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-105
- What was implemented: FastAPI backend — create_app factory with POST /api/analyze (multipart PDF upload + form fields) and GET /api/health endpoints, CORS for localhost:3000, dependency injection module.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/pyproject.toml` — added fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart dependencies
  - `backend/cantena/api/__init__.py` — new API package
  - `backend/cantena/api/deps.py` — create_pipeline() factory reading ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from env
  - `backend/cantena/api/app.py` — create_app factory, /api/health (200), /api/analyze (multipart form → PipelineResult JSON with estimate, summary_dict, export_dict)
  - `backend/tests/test_api.py` — 10 tests: health 200, analyze 200 with mocked pipeline, location passthrough, summary_dict/export_dict in response, non-PDF 400, missing fields 422, missing file 422, pipeline errors 500
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FastAPI `app.state` is dynamically typed — mypy doesn't require `type: ignore[attr-defined]` for attribute access
  - `create_app(pipeline=mock)` factory pattern eliminates need for env vars in tests
  - With `from __future__ import annotations`, `AnalysisPipeline` in type annotations is string-evaluated — can use `TYPE_CHECKING` block
  - FastAPI TestClient: use `files={"file": (name, io, content_type)}` and `data={...}` for multipart form posts
  - CantenaError hierarchy maps cleanly to HTTP status codes: custom pipeline errors → 500, FastAPI validation → 422, explicit file checks → 400
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-106
- What was implemented: Upload UI — full /analyze page with drag-and-drop PDF upload, project name/city/state form, staged loading progress, error state with retry, and results view (header, division breakdown, collapsible assumptions, AI reasoning, metadata footer).
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` — added AnalysisInfo and AnalyzeResponse interfaces for full backend response
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — updated return type from CostEstimate to AnalyzeResponse, removed TODO comment
  - `frontend/src/app/analyze/page.tsx` — complete rewrite: upload form with drag-and-drop, form fields, loading states with staged progress, error handling, ResultsView with division table/assumptions/AI reasoning/metadata, DisclosurePanel and ConfidenceBadge components
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `<Link>` from `next/link` for internal navigation — ESLint no-html-link-for-pages rule enforces this
  - Tailwind v4 CSS custom properties: use `var(--color-navy-xxx)` in arbitrary value syntax `[var(--color-navy-xxx)]`
  - `AnalyzeResponse` wraps the full backend response — estimate, summary_dict, export_dict, analysis (reasoning/warnings), processing_time_seconds, pages_analyzed
  - Staged loading progress uses setTimeout timers that are cleared in `finally` block to avoid stale state updates
  - File validation happens client-side (PDF extension + 50MB size) before API call
  - Results view sorts divisions by cost descending and highlights top 3 with subtle background color
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-107
- What was implemented: No new code needed — US-106 already implemented the full ResultsView with all US-107 acceptance criteria: header with project name/building summary/total cost/cost per SF, division breakdown table sorted by cost descending with top 3 highlighted, collapsible assumptions panel with confidence badges (green/yellow/red), collapsible AI reasoning panel with warnings, and metadata footer.
- Files changed: (none — only prd.json and progress.txt updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-106 was implemented comprehensively and already satisfied US-107 requirements — always check existing code before writing new code
  - The ResultsView component in page.tsx handles the full results display: header card, division table, assumptions disclosure, AI reasoning disclosure, and metadata footer
  - ConfidenceBadge uses lowercase keys from backend (`high`/`medium`/`low`) and CSS `uppercase` for display — no case conversion needed
  - DisclosurePanel is a reusable collapsible component already in page.tsx — use it for any new collapsible sections
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-108
- What was implemented: POST /api/estimate endpoint — accepts BuildingModel JSON body, runs CostEngine directly (no PDF/VLM), returns CostEstimate JSON.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/api/app.py` — added `cost_engine` param to `create_app()`, `_get_cost_engine()` lazy-loader, `POST /api/estimate` endpoint, imported `BuildingModel` with `noqa: TCH001`
  - `backend/tests/test_api.py` — added `TestEstimateEndpoint` with 2 tests (valid 200, invalid 422), updated `_create_test_client` to accept `cost_engine` param
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pydantic models used as FastAPI endpoint parameters must be imported at runtime — `from __future__ import annotations` defers evaluation but FastAPI resolves via `get_type_hints()`. Use `# noqa: TCH001` to suppress ruff's TC001 rule.
  - `CostEngine.estimate(building, project_name)` — the project_name can be derived from location fields when no explicit name is available
  - The `create_app` factory now accepts both `pipeline` and `cost_engine` for independent DI
  - `_get_cost_engine()` uses lazy initialization via `create_default_engine()` — no env vars needed for this endpoint
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-109
- What was implemented: Parameter override UI — editable building parameters section with confidence badges, Recalculate button, toggle between AI estimate and adjusted estimate. Also added `building_model` to `/api/analyze` response and `estimateFromModel` API client function.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/api/app.py` — added `building_model` field to `/api/analyze` response (from VlmAnalysisResult)
  - `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` — added `building_model: BuildingModel` to `AnalyzeResponse` interface
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — added `estimateFromModel(building)` function POSTing to `/api/estimate`
  - `frontend/src/app/analyze/page.tsx` — added `BuildingParametersEditor` component with editable dropdowns/inputs, `FieldWithConfidence` wrapper, recalculate logic, AI/Adjusted toggle, human-readable enum label maps
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Backend `/api/analyze` must include `building_model` in response so frontend can populate editable fields — was added to `result.analysis.building_model.model_dump()`
  - `structuredClone()` is the clean way to deep-copy BuildingModel for React state (avoids mutation of original)
  - `JSON.stringify` comparison works for change detection on BuildingModel since field order is deterministic from API
  - Enum label maps (`BUILDING_TYPE_LABELS`, `STRUCTURAL_LABELS`, `EXTERIOR_LABELS`) convert snake_case values to human-readable labels
  - FieldWithConfidence wraps each editable field with label + confidence badge — keeps the grid layout clean
  - Toggle between AI and adjusted estimates uses simple boolean state + conditional rendering
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-110
- What was implemented: Demo polish features — GET /api/sample-estimate endpoint (realistic 45K SF office in Baltimore), API key check on /api/analyze with helpful error, VLM 60-second timeout, "Try sample estimate" button on frontend, React error boundary wrapping /analyze route.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/api/app.py` — added `os` import, API key check in `/api/analyze`, `GET /api/sample-estimate` endpoint with realistic BuildingModel
  - `backend/cantena/services/vlm_analyzer.py` — added `timeout` param (default 60s) to `VlmAnalyzer.__init__`, passed to `anthropic.Anthropic(timeout=...)`
  - `backend/tests/test_api.py` — added `TestSampleEstimate` (sample returns 200 with full structure), `TestApiKeyCheck` (400 when no API key), imported `patch`
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — added `getSampleEstimate()` function calling GET /api/sample-estimate
  - `frontend/src/app/analyze/page.tsx` — added "Try sample estimate" button with `handleSample()`, `loadingSample` state
  - `frontend/src/app/analyze/error-boundary.tsx` — new file: `AnalyzeErrorBoundary` class component with "Something went wrong" + retry
  - `frontend/src/app/analyze/layout.tsx` — new file: wraps children with `AnalyzeErrorBoundary`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `anthropic.Anthropic(timeout=60.0)` works directly — no need for `httpx.Timeout` or custom client config
  - `@patch.dict("os.environ", {}, clear=True)` is needed to test API key absence when the env var is set globally
  - React error boundaries require class components — not possible with hooks alone
  - Error boundary goes in a separate file from page.tsx to keep it clean, wired through layout.tsx
  - Sample estimate endpoint uses deferred imports (inside the handler) to avoid circular imports and keep app.py light
  - The sample building model should match real use cases (3-story, 45K SF, steel-frame office, curtain wall, Baltimore)
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-111
- What was implemented: Docker Compose for local development — Dockerfiles for backend and frontend, docker-compose.yml, .env.example, and README.md with setup instructions.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/Dockerfile` — new file: Python 3.11-slim, PyMuPDF deps, pip install, uvicorn with reload
  - `frontend/Dockerfile` — new file: Node 20-slim, npm ci, next dev
  - `docker-compose.yml` — new file: backend (port 8000) + frontend (port 3000), volume mounts for hot reload, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from .env
  - `.env.example` — new file: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY placeholder
  - `README.md` — updated: overview, prerequisites, quick start, dev without Docker, architecture
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` must point to `http://localhost:8000` (not `http://backend:8000`) because API calls happen in the browser, not server-side
  - Use `/app/node_modules` anonymous volume in frontend container to avoid overwriting node_modules from host mount
  - Backend uses `--factory` flag with uvicorn to call `create_app()` at startup
  - Keep Dockerfiles simple — no multi-stage builds for dev mode
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-301
- What was implemented: Vector path extraction from PDF pages — VectorExtractor class that uses PyMuPDF `page.get_drawings()` to extract lines, rectangles, curves, and polylines as structured coordinate data.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/geometry/__init__.py` — new geometry package
  - `backend/cantena/geometry/extractor.py` — VectorExtractor, DrawingData, VectorPath, Point2D, BoundingRect, DrawingStats, PathType models and extraction logic
  - `backend/tests/test_extractor.py` — 11 tests: known geometry extraction (rect + 2 lines), rect coordinates, line coordinates with colors, filter_by_region excludes outside paths, filter preserves metadata, stats computed correctly, stats empty data, empty page returns empty, text-only returns empty paths, BoundingRect.contains, BoundingRect.intersects
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PyMuPDF `get_drawings()` "re" (rectangle) items are 3-element tuples `("re", Rect, orientation_flag)` — not 2 elements. Use `len(item) >= 2` guard.
  - PyMuPDF drawing dict values are typed as `object` from `dict[str, object]` — mypy strict requires `isinstance(raw, (int, float))` guard before calling `float()`.
  - `shape.draw_rect()` + `shape.finish()` + `shape.commit()` is the correct PyMuPDF sequence for creating test PDFs with known geometry.
  - Ruff E741 flags `l` as ambiguous variable name in generator expressions — use `seg` instead.
  - Frozen dataclasses (not Pydantic) are used for internal geometry models, consistent with existing service layer patterns (e.g., PipelineResult).
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-302
- What was implemented: Scale detection — ScaleDetector class with text-based scale parsing (architectural fractions, whole-inch, metric), dimension string parsing helper, dimension-based scale inference from nearby lines, and text block extraction from PDF pages.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/geometry/scale.py` — ScaleDetector, ScaleResult, TextBlock, Confidence models, parse_dimension_string helper, regex patterns for architectural/metric/whole-inch scales and dimension strings
  - `backend/tests/test_scale.py` — 24 tests: dimension parsing (feet-inches variants, decimal feet, unparseable), scale notation parsing (1/8"=1'-0" → 96, 1/4" → 48, 3/16" → 64, 1"=10'-0" → 120, 1:100, 1:50), messy text handling (extra spaces, no inch mark, embedded in title block), unparseable text returns None, dimension-based inference from nearby lines, text too far returns None, extract_text_blocks from real PDF
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PyMuPDF `page.get_text("blocks")` returns tuples of `(x0, y0, x1, y1, text, block_no, block_type)` — block_type 0 = text
  - Architectural scale regex needs to handle Unicode quote marks (U+201D, U+2033, U+2019, U+2032) in addition to ASCII quotes
  - `_FRACTION_MAP` dict maps common architectural fractions to decimal inches — avoids eval/parsing fraction strings
  - Dimension-based scale inference uses 50pt proximity threshold between text center and line midpoint
  - `re.VERBOSE` flag allows readable multi-line regex patterns with inline comments
  - `fullmatch` vs `finditer`: use fullmatch for dimension strings (exact match), finditer for scale notations (embedded in text)
  - Deferred import of `PathType` inside `detect_from_dimensions` to avoid circular imports
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-303
- What was implemented: Wall detection and room boundary identification — WallDetector class with heuristic wall filtering (stroke width, orientation, color), parallel line pair detection for wall thickness, Shapely-based convex hull area computation, and outer boundary detection.
- Files changed:
  - `backend/pyproject.toml` — added `shapely>=2.0.0` dependency
  - `backend/cantena/geometry/walls.py` — new file: WallDetector, WallSegment, WallAnalysis, Orientation models, wall filtering heuristics, parallel pair detection, Shapely-based area computation
  - `backend/tests/test_walls.py` — 11 tests across 5 test classes (TestThickVsThinLines, TestParallelWallPairs, TestEnclosedArea, TestEmptyAnalysis, TestOrientation)
  - `prd.json` — US-303 passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Shapely 2.x has type stubs (`types-shapely` pip package) — no `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` needed, but stubs must be installed separately
  - `MultiPoint.convex_hull` returns `BaseGeometry` — must use `isinstance(hull, Polygon)` check before accessing `.exterior` for mypy strict
  - Wall detection heuristic: stroke width >= 1.0 pts (~0.5mm), H/V orientation within ±2°, dark colors (RGB sum <= 1.0)
  - Parallel line pair detection uses perpendicular distance between midpoint and line — gap 2–20 pts range for wall thickness
  - `statistics.median()` for wall thickness from detected parallel pairs
  - Deferred shapely imports inside methods to avoid circular imports and keep module lightweight
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-304
- What was implemented: Scaled measurement service — MeasurementService class that combines VectorExtractor + ScaleDetector + WallDetector to produce real-world measurements (square feet, linear feet) from a single PDF page. Includes conversion functions pts_to_real_sf and pts_to_real_lf, MeasurementConfidence enum (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE), and graceful fallbacks (no vectors -> NONE, no scale -> estimated scale -> LOW, walls but no boundary -> MEDIUM, walls + boundary -> HIGH).
- Files changed:
  - `backend/cantena/geometry/measurement.py` — MeasurementService, PageMeasurements, MeasurementConfidence, pts_to_real_sf, pts_to_real_lf
  - `backend/tests/test_measurement.py` — 8 tests: conversion functions (SF at 1/8" scale, LF at 1/8" scale, SF at 1/4" scale, single wall LF), full pipeline with known PDF (area ~5000 SF, perimeter ~300 LF), empty page NONE confidence, missing scale LOW confidence
  - `prd.json` — US-304 passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Area formula: `area_sf = area_pts * (1/72)^2 * scale_factor^2 / 144` — converts sq points to sq paper inches, then to sq real inches, then to sq feet
  - Length formula: `length_lf = length_pts * (1/72) * scale_factor / 12` — converts points to paper inches, then to real inches, then to feet
  - At 1/8"=1'-0" (factor 96): 900pts × 450pts on paper = 100' × 50' = 5000 SF; perimeter 2700pts = 300 LF
  - MeasurementService uses the same frozen dataclass pattern as other geometry modules
  - Confidence cascade: NONE (no paths) -> LOW (estimated scale) -> MEDIUM (no outer boundary) -> HIGH (walls + boundary)
  - `_estimate_scale_from_page` returns a default 1/8"=1'-0" (factor 96) when no scale detected — conservative for architectural floor plans
  - Use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with context manager to satisfy ruff SIM115
